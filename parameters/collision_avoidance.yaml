# d_threshold:   Threshold from which the repulsive force starts acting, in [m]
# F_max:         Maximum amplitude of the repulsive force in [N] (when d=0 [m])
# order:         Order of the repulsive force polynomial
# BBX:           Bounding box dimensions in [m] around within which the closest distance to the present OctoMap cells is calculated (robot base frame will act as center point of the ground field)
