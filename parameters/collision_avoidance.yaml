# d_threshold:   Threshold from which the repulsive force starts acting, in [m]
# F_max:         Maximum amplitude of the repulsive force in [N] (when d=0 [m])
# F_min_percent: Below this force % it will not generate a repulsive force to prevent
#                blocking of the jacobian in that direction
# order:         Order of the repulsive force polynomial
# visualization_force_factor: repulsive forces will be calculated only when they are
#                < visualization_force_factor * d_threshold
